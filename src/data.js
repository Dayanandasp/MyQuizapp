        Option4: 'Redux is a part of HTML'
    },
    {
        Question: 'What is the main purpose of Redux?',
        Option1: 'To manage application state in a predictable way',
        Option2: 'To handle HTTP requests',
        Option3: 'To provide routing capabilities',
        Option4: 'To style components'
    },
    {
        Question: 'Which of the following is a core principle of Redux?',
        Option1: 'The state is read-only and can only be changed by dispatching actions',
        Option2: 'State can be mutated directly within components',
        Option3: 'Components manage their own state without any centralized store',
        Option4: 'All data is stored in local storage'
    },
    {
        Question: 'What is an action in Redux?',
        Option1: 'A plain JavaScript object that describes an event',
        Option2: 'A function that manages state changes',
        Option3: 'A built-in method for handling side effects',
        Option4: 'A UI component that triggers state changes'
    },
    {
        Question: 'What is the role of reducers in Redux?',
        Option1: 'Reducers specify how the state changes in response to actions',
        Option2: 'Reducers directly manipulate the DOM',
        Option3: 'Reducers handle side effects like fetching data',
        Option4: 'Reducers initialize the application'
    },
    {
        Question: 'What is the Redux store?',
        Option1: 'An object that holds the application state',
        Option2: 'A method for rendering components',
        Option3: 'A tool for managing API requests',
        Option4: 'A function that sends actions to the server'
    },

        Question: 'Which middleware is commonly used with Redux for handling asynchronous actions?',
        Option1: 'Redux Thunk',
        Option2: 'React Router',
        Option3: 'Redux DevTools',
        Option4: 'React Context'
    },
    {
        Question: 'What does Redux DevTools help with?',
        Option1: 'It provides tools for debugging and inspecting Redux actions and state',
        Option2: 'It optimizes performance by reducing API calls',
        Option3: 'It renders React components',
        Option4: 'It tracks network requests in real-time'
    },
    {
        Question: 'What is the purpose of the `dispatch` function in Redux?',
        Option1: 'It sends actions to the store to trigger state updates',
        Option2: 'It updates the UI components directly',
        Option3: 'It retrieves state from the store',
        Option4: 'It validates the applicationâ€™s state'
    },
    {
        Question: 'How does Redux handle state updates?',
        Option1: 'State updates are handled by actions and reducers in a unidirectional flow',
        Option2: 'State updates happen directly in UI components',
        Option3: 'State is updated using form submissions only',
        Option4: 'State is automatically updated by the browser'
